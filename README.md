# Crazy-Eights
The game is played between two players using a standard 52 card deck. Here's how it works:

* Seven cards are dealt to each player  
* The remaining cards are placed in a pile face down. This pile is called the "stock pile"
* The top card on the stock pile is removed and turned face up. It is now the first card in a new pile called the "discard pile". (Notice the stock pile cards are face down and the discard pile is face up.)
* Each turn a player discards a card from their hand into the discard pile by matching either the suit or the rank of the top card of the discard pile. If the player has no cards in their hand that match the suit or the rank, they must draw from the stock pile until they get a playable card or they may play an eight. The player's discarded card is now the top card of the discard pile.
* Eights are wild. That means an eight may be played at any time and the player discarding the eight then chooses the suit they wish the next player to have to match.
* If a player discards the final card in their hand, they win.
* If the stock pile is exhausted, the game ends and the player with the fewest cards left in their hand is declared the winner.
